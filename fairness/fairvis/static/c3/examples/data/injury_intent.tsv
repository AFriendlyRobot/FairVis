Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"
"available for those ages. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Ages 85-100."
"2. Circumstances in Georgia for the year 2008 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code"
"R99, ""Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified"". Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Georgia-Reporting-Anomalies."
"3. Circumstances in New Jersey for the year 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code"
"R99, ""Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified"" and therefore unusually low"
"death counts in other ICD-10 codes, most notably R95, ""Sudden Infant Death Syndrome"" and X40-X49, ""Unintentional poisoning."""
"Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#New-Jersey-Reporting-Anomalies."
"4. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable."
"5. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."
"6. Population figures for 2010 are April 1 Census counts. The population figures for years 2001 - 2009, other than the infant"
"age groups, are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the revised intercensal county-level 2000 - 2009"
"series released by NCHS on October 26, 2012. Population figures for 2000 are April 1 Census counts. Population figures for 1999"
"are from the 1990-1999 intercensal series of July 1 estimates. <br/><b>Note:</b> Rates and population figures for years 2001 -"
"2009 differ slightly from previously published reports, due to use of the population estimates which were available at the time"
"of release."
"7. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"
"resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age Group."
